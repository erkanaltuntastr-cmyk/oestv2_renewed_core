Dharmic Religions

The Dharmic religions are a group of religions that began in India. These include Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. They share some key ideas, such as the belief in dharma (living in the right way), karma (your actions have consequences), samsara (the cycle of birth, death and rebirth) and the ultimate goal of moksha or nirvana (freedom from this cycle). Dharmic religions often focus on meditation, prayer, respect for all living things, and the importance of self-discipline in reaching spiritual goals.

Abrahamic Religions

The Abrahamic religions are religions that trace their history back to the prophet Abraham. These include Judaism, Christianity and Islam, which all began in the Middle East. They share the belief in one God (monotheism), who created the world and guides humanity. They also believe in holy books such as the Torah (Judaism), the Bible (Christianity), and the Qur'an (Islam), and they teach moral rules about how people should live. Although they are different, the Abrahamic religions are linked by their shared roots and many similar stories about God and prophets.

Atheism is the belief that there is no God or gods. Atheists do not accept the idea of a higher power or creator, often because they think there is not enough evidence to support belief in God. Instead, atheists look to science, reason and human experience to explain the world around them. They may still have strong morals and values, but these come from human ideas about right and wrong, not from religious teachings.

Humanism

Humanism is a non-religious worldview that focuses on people, reason, and compassion. Humanists believe that this life is the only one we have, so we should make the most of it and try to live happily and help others. They do not believe in God, heaven, or hell, but they see science, evidence, and human experience as the best ways to understand the world. Humanists often celebrate important events (like births, weddings and funerals) with humanist ceremonies instead of religious ones, and they promote values like kindness, fairness and respect for human rights.

How do beliefs affect actions?

What people believe is often seen in the way they behave and the way they treat the people around them. For example, they might stand up for human rights, speak out against oppression, look after the poor or do charity work. Expressing their beliefs in action often involves putting others before themselves and making sacrifices.

Holding religious beliefs can also affect someone's day-to-day life. Many religions have rules. These can cover all sorts of things, for example:

* what to wear

* what to eat

* how to worship and pray

* celebrations and festivals

Belief that life has a meaning – Many religious people believe that life has a purpose. Following a religion helps them to make sense of their life. It helps them to deal with big questions such as, “why are we here?” and “why is there suffering in the world?” Some religious people believe that their purpose in life is to serve God and others. They believe God guides them in their lives and when they die they will achieve life after death in heaven. Others believe they will continually be reborn into other lives until they have earned a life which is good enough to earn them heavenly bliss.

Belief that life is sacred – Most followers of religion believe that life is sacred. This means that they believe that all life, including animals, should be treated with respect. For some people this will mean thinking carefully about how they treat all life. They think that there is more to a human being than the physical body. They believe there is an inner self, a spirit or a soul.

Timeline of religions

The six main world religions began at different times in history and in different parts of the world. Hinduism (1700 BCE) started in India and teaches about one supreme God, Brahman. Judaism (2000 BCE) began with Abraham and focuses on one God and the promise of a messiah. Buddhism (563 BCE) was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in India and teaches how actions affect rebirth. Christianity (1st century CE) grew from Judaism, with followers believing Jesus is God's son and a Saviour. Islam (610 CE) began in Arabia when the prophet Muhammad received God's message in the Qur'an. Sikhism (1400 CE) was founded by Guru Nanak in India, teaching equality and service. Each religion has holy books, symbols, festivals, and millions of followers around the world today.
